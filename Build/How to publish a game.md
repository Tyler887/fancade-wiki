Click on your game and tap `Publish` to publish it. Published games are available for everyone to play in the Arcade.

You can also publish your Fancade game anywhere on the web. E.g. use something like this index.html to publish on itch.io:

```
<html>
	<head></head>
	<body>
		<iframe src="https://play.fancade.com/entrenched" style="position:fixed; left:0px; top: 0px; width:100%; height:100%; border: none"></iframe>
	</body>
</html>
```
