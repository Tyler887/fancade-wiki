The *Box Art* Button was a button added in version 1.3.1 of Fancade. Its icon was a face in a box. It was used to edit the box art of the game (not that of individual levels). It was removed in 1.6, with its functionality now accessible via tapping the game or level covers themselves.

- Clicking on it while not selecting a level would make the game cover be that of the first level.
  - Since version 1.6, this is instead done by tapping the game's box art, next to the description.
- Clicking on it while a level is selected used to make Fancade go into play mode, and the last frame captured while playing would've been set as the cover of the game.
  - Since version 1.4.3, you're able to click a camera button, with the ability to crop it. 
  - Since version 1.6, you can instead tap on the cover of a level to enter this mode.
