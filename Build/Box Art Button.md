The "Boxart" Button is a button added in version 1.3.1 of Fancade. Its icon is a smiley in a box.

- Clicking on it while not selecting a level will make the base game cover be the first level (with boxart sensor enabled).
- Clicking on it a level is selected will make Fancade into play mode (boxart sensor being disabled), and the last frame captured while playing will be the base game cover.
