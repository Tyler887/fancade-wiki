The *Box Art* Button was a button added in version 1.3.1 of Fancade. Its icon is a face in a box.

- Clicking on it while not selecting a level will make the base game cover be the first level (with boxart sensor enabled).
- Clicking on it while a level is selected will make Fancade go into play mode (boxart sensor being disabled), and the last frame captured while playing will be the base game cover.
  - On version 1.4.3 update, you were able to click a camera button, with the ability to crop it. 
  - On version 1.6, you can tap on the floppy disk's cover instead.

This has been removed on 1.6 update, instead you can tap on the box art cover located on the right side.
