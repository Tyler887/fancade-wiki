You've made a game? Awesome! You want it to be listed in Spotlight so that many more people can play and enjoy it? Cool! The games are hand-picked, but there are many things you can do to increase your chances of being selected.

First, there are some things to avoid, which shouldn't be too hard:

- No copyright violations (E.g. don't copy sprites or levels from some other game that you did not make. It is fine to copy your own level in your game(s), as long as you change the design or scripts of the level.)
- No game collections (E.g. don't make the first level Floppy Fish and the second level Tumble. Focus on one game and let *Fancade* be the *collection* of games.)
- No orientation lock (E.g. don't force the player to use landscape mode. If they want to play in portrait mode, despite the game working best in landscape, then let them.)
- No box art level (E.g. don't make the first level just a pretty picture, learn to use the [[Box Art Sensor]] instead.)
- No impossible difficulty (E.g. if your game has "hard", "impossible", "kaizo", or "troll" in the title, then it's probably too hard for most users, and unlikely to be featured.)
- No blood and/or gore (E.g. Fancade games contain safe art that is very perfect! But blood and gore textures are dangerous, so draw safe art only.)

Then, the interesting things you *should* do, which are probably harder, but oh so worthwhile:

- Simple controls (E.g. one-tap, swipe, drag and tilt all work well on touch screens. There are many other options, but try to make it clear what the player is supposed to do.)
- Easy difficulty (We all underestimate how hard others will think our games are. Start super easy! Gradually increase difficulty in later levels.)
- Make it look good (Use Fancade's strengths, colorful blocky low res art. That art style was chosen so that those of us who're not pro artists can still make something simple look OK.)
- Add enough content (Fancade games can be very short, because there's many other games to move onto! But it won't get featured if it's just one level that can be completed in a few seconds.)

If your game manages to achieve many of these, then it's probably also fun to play! That's easier said than done, but most games on Spotlight have gotten help via our [[Discord]], with play testing and helpful suggestions, ~~lol~~, no jokes. Yours can too!
