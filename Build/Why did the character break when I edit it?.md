Many characters have a pink wire from the block to a script [[Set Variable]]. If you remove the voxel the wire is attached to, the wire is removed too.

To fix it, open the block and see if there's a pink [[Set Variable]] that seems oddly disconnected. If so, drag to connect it to the block, and check if it works!

(If this didn't work, try asking the game's original creator for help on [[Discord]]!)
