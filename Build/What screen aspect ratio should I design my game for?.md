Here are the most common mobile screen aspect ratios in [[2019|https://deviceatlas.com/blog/most-used-smartphone-screen-resolutions#us]]:

- 16:9 (1.78) 69.12%
- 18.5:9 (2.06) 8.96%
- 19.5:9 (2.17) 4.56%
- 2:1 (2.0)  3.10%

This means, if your game is 10 blocks wide, 86% of users will fit at least 18 blocks high, and max 22 blocks. Presumably some of the other 14% are on tablets with a 4:3 (1.33) aspect ratio, only seeing 13 blocks high.
