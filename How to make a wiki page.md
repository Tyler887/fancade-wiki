**Intro**

This is a tutorial/documentation on how to make a new page on this wiki.
Just make sure the page is Fancade related, and complies with the wiki's rules!
**Tutorial**

Making a wiki page is simple. It's like making a document in a program like Microsoft Word.

To make a wiki page, you have to enter the Fancade Wiki's home page, then click the "New" button. [[/uploads/New_button.PNG]]

Once you clicked the "New" button, you will be prompted to enter a page name. Enter it, and press OK. [[/uploads/new_page.PNG]]

Once you pressed OK, you will be prompted to enter your e-mail adress and password that's associated to your Fancade account. Go and enter them, and press OK. You will be redirected to your newly created page. [[/uploads/page_1.PNG]]

It's time to edit your page. Write anything you want, upload some images.
**How to upload images**

You can use any tool to make an image. In this tutorial, I use Snipping Tool, which is available on any PC. Screenshot any area you want, then save it on your device and give it a name. [[/uploads/screenshot_example.PNG]]

(Screenshot this!)

Once you saved it, scroll up a little bit until you find the "Upload" button. Click it, and select a file to upload. [[/uploads/upload.PNG]]

Click the "Choose File" button and locate the file you want to upload. Click OK.

Now, once you chose the file and clicked ok, type [[/uploads/example.PNG]] without the quotation marks, without the spaces and without the square brackets on the "filename" part. And replace "filename" with the name of your image.

Scroll up a little bit, then click Preview. You will see that your file was uploaded as an image.

**Conclusion**

This was it about the tutorial. If a wiki moderator requests me to take down the page, I have no problem with that. 

Now you are a wiki pro! Remember to read the wiki rules, make Fancade related pages and I wish you happy writing! :)
