Wanna know how you can publish or update game after game in less than 24 hours?

Martin only allows premium/ad free fancaders to publish or update game after game without 24h cooldown, which was added to reduce "spam". The publish or update button will show how long the creator needs to wait to publish or update again if time is not up or you have no Fancade Premium.

***New in Fancade 1.7.7:***

*The 24h cooldown has been decreased to 10m. Recently published/updated games now will appear on the New tab and Search soon after verification steps*
