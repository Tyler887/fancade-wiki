FanJam is a Fancade event that happens every 1 to 3 months. It is hosted in the [[Fancade Discord Server|Discord]] by one of moderators, Sounak9434. Everything about FanJam is announced in the #fanjam channel.

## Mechanics

Sounak9434 announces an upcoming FanJam including the set of rules about a week prior to the event.

FanJam consists of 3 phases:

1. Development Phase
2. Voting Phase
3. Announcing of Winners

There are also 3 categories:

- Overall - The best games overall
- Art - Games with the most beautiful art
- Innovation - The most innovative games

There was a Kit category for games made with kits, but it is now eligible for the 3 categories.

### Development Phase

On the start of the event, a selected theme will be announced, then all the participants can finally start to build their own games depending on their depiction of the theme. This phase usually lasts for 3 days. Creators can publish and update games during this period.

When submitting games for FanJam, creators must send it in #showcase, with "#fanjam" on its message. Only one submission is accepted.

After the time period is done, there is an extension for non-published games that has not been able to reach the deadline or games that has a critical bug.

### Voting Phase

During this time, all people in the Discord server can see all submissions, and it will be posted with their direct links for easy access. People can vote on games by sending "`.vote`". Creators cannot update games in this period or they will be penalized.
