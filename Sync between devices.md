Got a new phone? Or want to play on your tablet as well?

1. On your old phone, create a Fancade account with email + password.
2. On your new phone, sign into the same Fancade account.

That's the gist of it. But some stuff requires additional steps. Details below.

## Premium and Gems

No extra steps needed!

## Quest Progress

Quest progress sync was introduced in Fancade 1.4. It's not completely automatic, so:

1. On the device you've played Quest, Tap Save Quest on the [[You]] page.
2. On the device you'd like to continue on, tap Load Quest.

## High Scores

Online leaderboards were introduced in Fancade 1.5. As long as your Fancade account has a nickname set, your best scores will sync automatically.

## Game Builds

Games that you've published can always be edited on any of your devices:

1. Publish the game.
2. On your second device, go to the Arcade, scroll down, and tap New to find the game, and tap Edit. (This works for you, even if the game was published as Can't edit, because Fancade will recognize you as the original creator.)
3. Optionally, unpublish the game again, if it's not yet ready for other users to play.

## Other Stuff

For syncing anything else, if you're on Android, [[use the built-in cloud backup functionality|https://support.google.com/android/answer/2819582]] to back up your old phone to your Google account. Then, when you setup your new phone, use the option to restore from your Google account backup to sync everything over! If you use iOS, you cannot sync all of Fancade's data. But you can sign in to the account you used and do every single thing above.
