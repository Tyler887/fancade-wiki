If you're on Android, [[use the built-in cloud backup functionality|https://support.google.com/android/answer/2819582]] to back up your old phone to your Google account. Then, when you setup your new phone, use the option to restore from your Google account backup to sync everything over!

If you're on iOS, or don't want to use Android's cloud backup, there's no automagic Fancade sync (yet). But any game you've published can be downloaded again as editable on your new device! Just sign in to the same Fancade account. (If you don't have a Fancade account, create one on the old device, and use it on your new device.)  For games that you yourself are building, you'll need to publish the games from the old device, download them on the new device, and un-publish the games again, until they're ready for release!
