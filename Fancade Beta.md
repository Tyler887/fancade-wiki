The Beta version of Fancade usually has more bug fixes and features than the public Fancade version, but it may have some untested bugs which the beta players can report to the [[Fancade Discord Server|Discord]]'s [[#bugs|https://discord.com/channels/409219533618806786/464440412116090880]] channel or [support@fancade.com](mailto:support@fancade.com) so that nobody else runs into the bugs on the stable Fancade releases.

You can sign up for beta on the Fancade page in the Play Store by clicking the `Join` button below the install button. If you have done that, the display name of the app will be `Fancade (Beta)` instead of `Fancade`.

Good luck with testing new features and remember to report the bugs to Martin Magni!
