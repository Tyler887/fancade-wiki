# Submitting to Fancade's leaderboards

As of version 1.5.1 your score on a published game will appear on Fancade's leaderboard when the game over or win screen appears. All you need for your score to be submitted is an internet connection!

# Submitting to the Discord's leaderboards

Alternatively, if you would like to submit your score to the [[Discord|https://discord.gg/P8VHwVq]] leaderboard you can follow the steps below:

Navigate to the [[#scores|https://discord.com/channels/409219533618806786/490115251014991872]] channel and send a screenshot of your score screen with a caption following the example below.

The correct text for this screenshot is:

"Endless Dash (Rocketernity) 567"

* "Endless Dash" is the name of the game
* "Rocketernity" is the name of the level 
* 567 is the score

Then just wait for a Fanmod to react to it so it can be added to the scores.
