# Fancade 0.1

<<Warn("WIP: This section of the article is not finished")>>

Fancade 0.1 was released in July 2017, back then, you were still unable to make your own blocks, and the game used a fixed set of pre-made building blocks.

# Pre-Beta

<<Warn("WIP: This section of the article is not finished")>>

Pre-Beta is an older version of Fancade Beta. It has more bugs and less features. (The older, the buggier, so pre beta update 1 is the buggiest Fancade version, bugs are fixed in updates.) You were unable to make your own blocks, and the game used a fixed set of pre-made building blocks.
