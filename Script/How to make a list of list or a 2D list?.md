List of list (nested list) is currently not possible with the current list script as of now, but there is a simple workaround to make it by using simple math. See image below on how to make it!

**Variables**:
- *X*: the index column of a 2D list
- *Y*: the index row of a 2D list
- *Columns*: the total columns of a 2D list

Two-dimensional list is mostly used in creating a game that involves a *board* or a *grid* such as Chess, Reversi, Checkers, Tetris, Battleship, 2048 and so on.

In a technical term, 2D list is called as an array of arrays or also known as a matrix which can be represented as a table of columns and rows.
