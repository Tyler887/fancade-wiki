Wire splits occur when you link an output wire to 2 or more (max 8) inputs.

# Notes
Wire splitting counts as 1 script towards the script limit, it doesn't matter how many inputs the wire is connected to, it will always count as 1 script towards the script limit.

# Trivia
In an early alpha of the game, the game originally had script blocks specifically used for splitting wires.
