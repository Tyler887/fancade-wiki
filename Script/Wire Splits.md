Wire splits occur when you link an output wire to 2 or more (max 8) inputs.

# Notes
Splitting an output wire into 2 actually uses more scripts than if you use individual outputs, but splitting a wire into 3 or more uses *less* of the script limit.

# Trivia
In an early alpha of the game, the game originally had script blocks specifically used for splitting wires.
