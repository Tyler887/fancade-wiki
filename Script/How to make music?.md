## For everyone
Using Tim0lmazan's '[game music kit](https://fancade.page.link/f4pG)', you can make music with blocks which don't have any scripts inside them! You might need to copy the sheet block a little to make longer songs. Also, the sound pitch depends on the [Z position](https://www.fancade.com/wiki/Build/Which%20direction%20is%20X%2CY%2CZ%3F.md).

## For experienced creators
You can use a modulo and just detect the frame. Use a number. You need a beat var, unless using [[Current Frame]]. Then, do this math: ^(2,รท(any, 12))

Now choose to play a sound when the event is detected!

Tip of the day from Tyler 2013: Make a note to pitch script to make everything easier.

## Don't want to make but want music?
Find a editable working music on Fancade game search on the Fancade app. But if you think the music is too bad for your game, then try to modify it. (If you can't modify it, then the music's editablity is set to 'Levels' and you can't make a editable game using it.)
