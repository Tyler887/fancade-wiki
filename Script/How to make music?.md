## For everyone
Using Tim0lmazan's '[game music kit](https://fancade.page.link/f4pG)', you can make music with blocks which don't have any scripts inside them! You might need to copy the sheet block a little to make longer songs. Also, the sound pitch depends on the [Z position](Build/Which direction is X,Y,Z?).

## For experienced creators
You can use a modulo and just detect the frame. Use a number. You need a beat var, unless using [[Current Frame]]. Then, do this math: ^(2,รท(any, 12))

Now choose to play a sound when the event is detected!

## Don't want to make but want music?
Find a editable working music on Fancade game search on the Fancade app. But if you think the music is too bad for your game, then try to modify it.
