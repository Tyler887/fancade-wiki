Use [[Current Frame]] and then use an [[If]] to check for an event. 

If you want it to count in seconds divide it by 60.

The 3 examples in the picture will have a different behavior:

1) Will make the sound play every second. Change the number 1 in the % for the number of seconds you desired.

2) Will only play the sound once after 1 second.

3) Will play a sound after 30 frames.
