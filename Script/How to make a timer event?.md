Make a variable go up by 1 each frame and then use an if to check for an event. 

if you use the variable by itself it'll be in frames, if you want it to count in seconds divide it by 60.

The 3 examples in the picture will have a different behavior:

1) Will make the sound play every second. Change the number 1 in the % for the number of seconds you desired.

2) Will only play the sound once after 1 second.

3) Will play a sound after 30 frames.
