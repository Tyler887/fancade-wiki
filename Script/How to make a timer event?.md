Use [[Current Frame]] and [[If]] to check for an event. 

The 3 examples in the picture will have a different behavior:

1) Will make the sound play every 60 frames. Change the number 60 in the % for the number of frames you desired.

2) Will only play the sound once after 60 frames.

3) Will play a sound after 30 frames.
