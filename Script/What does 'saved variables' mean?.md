A saved variable is persistent, it was made for [[Menu Item]] to work. Saved variables were introduced in Fancade 1.6.

If a local variable is accessible on the same floor, and a global variable is accessible on the same level, then a saved variable is accessible everywhere inside the game, regardless of any limit! This is really usefull if you want to create custom game settings, autosave, shop system, and more!

Saved variables currently only work with number variables, and saved variable can't be interpreted as a list.

A game can have up to 64 saved num variables
