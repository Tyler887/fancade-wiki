Also called hitbox, it determines if the object is solid or pass through.

Since Bullet Physics is somewhat buggy some people tend to create custom colliders using [[Raycast]] to detect blocks and create physics like movements using vector math. This is done because the [[Collision]] script only works on objects with physics applied.
