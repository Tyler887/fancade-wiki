The sound effects script requires a yellow wire to trigger the sound effect. If you are making an ambient sound that will play throughout the game, try wiring the Play Sensor to the sound effect. If you want the sound to play when something happens, such as when the player taps the screen, try using a yellow wire that triggers at the appropriate time.
