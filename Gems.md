Gems are a currency in Fancade. You can get a certain amount of gems by getting [[Premium|You.md#premium]], or collect them from in-game shops. You can use them to buy [[coins]], or speed up [[Quest]] progress. If someone buys coins from one of your in-game shops, you get half of the gems that they spent.

You can also get gems by playing the challenges in the [[web version of Fancade.|Fancade Web]]
