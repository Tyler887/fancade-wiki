Gems are a currency in Fancade. You can buy them with real money, or collect them from in-game shops. You can use them to buy [coins](https://www.fancade.com/wiki/Coins.md), or speed up [quest](https://www.fancade.com/wiki/Quest) progress. If someone buys coins from one of your in-game shops, you get half of the gems that they spent.
