Gems are a currency in Fancade. You can buy them with real money in your country/region (Fancade detects where you live and checks its currency type), or collect them from in-game shops. You can use them to buy [[coins]], or speed up [[Quest]] progress. If someone buys coins from one of your in-game shops, you get half of the gems that they spent.
