Inverses a [[rotation]] value similarly on how [[negate]] works.

Input:
- Rot : Rotation value

Output:
- Rot Inverse : the inversed rotation


## Notes 

Due to some ***mathematical*** issues the rotation value seems  to be innacurate , but don't worry it's just normal and it doesn't affect any things about the rotation!

## Example

_Inverts the rotation of 3,9,5._
