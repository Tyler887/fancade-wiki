Inputs:

* Tru1: The first boolean value to check.
* Tru2: The second boolean value to check.

Outputs:

* Boolean: Combines Tru1 & Tru2, returns True if either input is True.

## Notes
* This script block can be combined with [[If]] block to check if either Tru1 and Tru2 inputs are True. You can also use the logical [[AND]] operator to check if both Inputs are True.

## Examples
* The top one returns True because both inputs are True.
* The middle one returns True because one of the inputs is True.
* The last one returns False because both of the inputs are False.
