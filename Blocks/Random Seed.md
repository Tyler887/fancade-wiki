Set the random seed. (Use this if you want the same random numbers
 each time.)

When you generate random numbers with random, you will get different numbers each play cause the seed changes. A seed is a number that the random function uses to generate the values. 

So if you want to get the same sequence of random numbers, set a seed on play.
