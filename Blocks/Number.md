# Numbers
The number is the most common data type. Numbers are represented by blue wires.

Numbers are stored as [[32-bit floats|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format]].
This gives numbers a maximum value of **340,282,346,638,528,859,811,704,183,484,516,925,440**. Likewise, their minimum value is the negative of that.

Numbers have about 7 digits of precision. This means that numbers with 8 digits or more may begin to give slightly inaccurate results, e.g. when [[adding|Add Numbers]] numbers together. The margin of error is usually tiny, but gets larger the more digits you have.
