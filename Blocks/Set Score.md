Sets the score and/or coin amount.

* When you got 1.6, you may have found another input which sets the amount of coins the player will claim at the end of the game (it's not a scam, it just adds coins). [(Don't know what coins mean?)](Coins)

There is a setting that determines which score should be considered as a better one:

* Most points: the higher the better
* Fewest points: the lower the better

You also can provide time score. But make sure that the input is a total amount of seconds and you selected one of these options:

* Fastest time: the faster the better
* Longest time: the longer the better

Setting a score with the [[negate]] sign hides the score.
