Sets the score and/or [[coins]].

* In Fancade 1.6, a second input is made available to set the amount of Coins the player can get playing a game.

There is a setting that determines which score to consider as better one.

* Most Points: the more points the better
* Fewest Points: the less points the better

You also can provide time score, just make sure that the input is a total amount of seconds and you selected one of these options:

* Fastest Time: the faster the better
* Longest Time: the longer the better

Setting a negative score removes the score.
