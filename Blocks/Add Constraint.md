Creates a new constraint between two physics objects. You probably only want to do this once, [[on Play|Play Sensor]].

## Notes
Have you ever heard of hydraulics and motors? If not then let me explain it to you and the connection of it in this script:

Hydraulic and Motors are both type of motors that produces different movements using either similar or different elements:
- Hydraulic – from the word hydro, usually uses fluids (either water or air) to produce [[Linear Motor]] movements that can also be achieved with the use of gears and Rotary Motor in real life.
- Motor – the most common motor we know. It produces rotary movements. In Fancade we can produce something like it with the help of constraints and [[Angular Motor]]

So, to be exact: constraints are basically the relations of motors, pivotals , gears and springs!
