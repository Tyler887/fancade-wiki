## Notes
Have you ever heard of hydraulics and motors? If not then let me explain it to you and the connection of it in this script ;

*Hydraulic and Motors , are both type of motors that produces different movements using either similar or different elements:
- Hydraulic – from the word hydro , it usually uses fluids (either water or air) to produce [[Linear Motor]] movements can also be achieved with the use of gears and Rotary Motor in real life.
- Motor – the most common motor we know , it produces rotary movements , in fancade we can produce something like it with the help of constraints and [[Angular Motor]]
