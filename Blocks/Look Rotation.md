Given an input Direction, output a Rotation, as if you were standing at 0,0,0 and turned your head to look in that direction. 

You can usually ignore the second Up input, and it'll default to 0,1,0. But if the look direction is in the same plane, you'll get weird rotation outputs, and need to provide an Up input that's orthogonal to looking plane.
