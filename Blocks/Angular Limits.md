Changes a constraint's angular limits. Set the lower limit higher than the upper limit for completely unlimited movement.

Examples:
- Lower 0,0,0 and Upper 180,0,0 allows the part to rotate up to 180 degrees (half of a full rotation) in one direction around the X axis (the right arrow when looking from the top down), similar to a lever
- Lower 0,0,-360 and Upper 0,0,360 allows the part to rotate up to a full turn in both directions around the Z axis (the up arrow), similar to a steering wheel
- Lower 0,1,0 and Upper 0,0,0 allows the part to rotate freely around the Y axis (height), similar to a fidget spinner
