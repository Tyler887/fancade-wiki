Linear Interpolation (LERP) returns a value between two others at a point of linear scale.

The formula for the LERP output is:
From + (To - From) Ã— Amount

Input:
- From: The value to transition from.
- To: The value to transition to.
- Amount: How far to transition.

Output:
- Rotation: The value between the From and To input, at a linear scale (defined by Amount input).

## Example

The most common use case is to smoothly transition from one rotation to another.

On every frame, the block rotates from it's initial rotation (From) closer to it's target rotation (To) by a scaled amount (Speed),
