Outputs the logarithm of a number by a given base.

[[/uploads/Logarithm.png]]

Inputs
- Number: The target number
- Base: The base to raise (defaults to [*e*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) if unwired)

Outputs
- Logarithm: The Exponent in the (Base ^ Exponent = Number)

## Notes
Logarithm is used as an inverse function for the function [[Power]] , this function is most commonly use for pathfinding AI's such as Board game AI's. If you managed to learn how to make an AI , this function will be surely handy for you!

## Examples
If you're looking for examples , surely all examples for this is complex , One most common example of how it can be used is seen in "Sounak9434's" (he is one of our @Fanmods Btw) **MCTS Engine** , its a type of AI used for board games.

- ***MCTS Engine*** is made before the logarithm function is implemented , the logarithm function used in the MCTS engine is a custom script made by our great "Potato-Chan" one of the best scripter we have here! (~~though I wonder why he is not a Fanmod too Probably cause he is not mostly active in discord~~)
- Logarithm is used in the MCTS engine as a function to find the best possible moves the AI can execute in the set of given possible moves and the players possible moves in the game.
