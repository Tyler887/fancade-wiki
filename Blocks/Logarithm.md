Inputs
- Number: The target number
- Base: The base to raise (defaults to *e* if unwired)

Outputs
- Logarithm: The Exponent in the (Base ^ Exponent = Number)

## Notes
Logarithm is used as an inverse function for the function [[Power]] , this function is most commonly use for pathfinding AI's such as Board game AI's. If you managed to learn how to make an AI , this function will be surely handy for you.

## Examples
If you're looking for examples , surely all examples for this is complex , But if you really want to see how it's used you can look for "Sounak9434's" (he is one of our @Fanmods Btw) MCTS Engine its a board AI you can how logarithm is used there.

***MCTS Engine*** is made before the logarithm function is implemented the logarithm function used in the MCTS engine is a custom script made by our great "Potato-Chan" one of the best scripters we have here (~~though I wonder why he is not a Fanmod too Probably cause he is not mostly active in discord~~).
