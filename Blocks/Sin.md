Compute sine of an angle in degrees.

[[/uploads/Sin.png]]
## Input/Ouput

Sine outputs value between 1 and -1 depending on the given value to it which scales from rotation (0°–360°)

## Notes

Additionally , there are only 4 certain points where you can get a whole number :
- 0°/360° = 0
- 90° = 1
- 180° = 0
- 270° = -1

*Note: To understand more better search for "trigonemetrical functions" in google XD

## Example 
Ever wondered how martin make those ultra smooth floating coin animations , well here's how to do it:

- Sin and Cos is mostly use for such back and forth animations like this floating coin animation, you can also amplify the output of the sin or cos to make the object have a back and forth animation in a larger scale.
