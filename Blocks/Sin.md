Compute sine of an angle in degrees.

[[/uploads/Sin.png]]
## Input/Ouput

Sine outputs value between 1 and -1 depending on the given value to it which scales from angular (0°–360°), though values outside this range work as well.

## Notes

Additionally, there are only 4 certain points where you can get a whole number:
- 0°/360° = 0
- 90° = 1
- 180° = 0
- 270° = -1

## Example 
Ever wondered how to make those ultra smooth floating coin animations like in Roper? Here's how to do it:

(Note that you don't have to store the input in a rotation. A number or [[Current Frame]] will do just fine.)
- Sin and [[Cos]] can be used for such back and forth animations like this. You can also multiply the output of sin or cos by a number to move it in a larger or smaller scale. If you manage to utilize this function, you can even make any type of animations very smooth (e.g. walking animation, gun Recoil animation, moving platforms, etc.)!
