Compute sine of an angle in degrees.

[[/uploads/Sin.png]]
## Input/Ouput

Sine outputs value between 1 and -1 depending on the given value to it which scales from angular (0°–360°), though values outside this range work as well.

## Notes

Additionally , there are only 4 certain points where you can get a whole number :
- 0°/360° = 0
- 90° = 1
- 180° = 0
- 270° = -1

*Note: To understand more better search for "trigonemetrical functions" in Google

## Example 
Ever wondered how martin make those ultra smooth floating coin animations , well here's how to do it:

(Note that you don't have to store the input in a rotation. A number will do just fine.)
- Sin and [[Cos]] is mostly use for such back and forth animations like this , you can also amplify the output of the sin or cos to make the object have a back and forth animation in a larger or smaller scale. If you managed to utilize this functions you can even make any type of animations very smooth e.g. (walking animation , gun recoil animation , moving platforms and many more)
