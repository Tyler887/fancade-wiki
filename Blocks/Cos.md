Compute cosine of an angle in degrees.

[[/uploads/Cos.png]]

## Input/Output
Similar to the function [[sin]] but instead, the output value starts from 1. Outputs value between 1 and -1 depending on the given input which, scales from angular (0°–360°)

## Notes

Additionally , there are only 4 certain points where you can get a whole number :
- 0°/360° = 1
- 90° = 0
- 180° = -1
- 270° = 0

## Example
**Looking for examples!!** 
- You can refer to the example in [[sin]].
