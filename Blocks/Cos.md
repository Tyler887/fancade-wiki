Compute cosine of an angle in degrees.

[[/uploads/Cos.png]]

## Input/Output
Similar to the function [[Sin]] but instead, the output value starts from 1. Outputs value between 1 and -1 depending on the given input which, scales from angular (0°–360°)

## Notes

Additionally, there are only 4 certain points where you can get a whole number:
- 0°/360° = 1
- 90° = 0
- 180° = -1
- 270° = 0

## Example

- You can refer to the example in [sin](https://www.fancade.com/wiki/Blocks/Sin.md#example).
