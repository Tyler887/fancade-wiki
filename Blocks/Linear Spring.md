Makes the constraint springy, like a car's suspension.

The [[linear limits]] constraint is necessary because it stores the upper and lower limits between which the objects can move. Adding a linear spring script makes the objects "spring" between these upper and lower limits. To find the perfect "stiffness" and "damping" values for your game, trying copying the ones above and then adjust them until you get the results you were looking for.

# Examples

Before this script will function as expected, a "linear limits" constraint must be applied to the same two objects. An image is shown below.
