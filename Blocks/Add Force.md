Adds force and/or torque to an object.

Notes:
* A torque force applied on the first frame, or the same frame that an object is created, seems to have no effect. (A normal force works just fine, and torque forces work just fine after the first frame. The reason is still unknown, perhaps some peculiarity in Bullet Physics?)
