The Loop block is used to run a script multiple times in the same frame. Often used for processing every element in a list.

Inputs
- Start: The Loop blocks starts looping from the Start input.
- Stop: Then it stops looping once it reaches the Stop input.

Outputs
- Do: Plug this to the script that you want to run for every loop.
- Counter: Outputs the current loop number counting from the Start value. If the Start value is greater than the Stop value, it counts down instead of up.
