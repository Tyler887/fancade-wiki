Creates a copy of the input object.

Making *too* many objects will affect performance negatively, so clone responsibly. And if you try to make more than 4096 objects, you'll be punished with a "Too many objects" error message. It's for your own protection.

*Note:* Due to technical limitations, the object's scripts will not be copied. Fixing this is on [[Martin's|Martin Magni]] to-do list!
