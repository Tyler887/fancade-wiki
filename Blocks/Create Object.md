Creates a copy of the input object. (Note that due to technical limitations, the object's scripts will not be copied. Fixing this is on my todo list!)
Making *too* many objects will affect performance negatively, so clone responsibly. And if you try to make more than 4096 objects you'll be punished with a "Too many objects" error message. It's for your own protection.
