Changes the direction that light falls onto your blocks. (Ignore the Position input, it's not currently used for anything.)

## Tip of the day, by Potato Chan
If your game is in a top-down view that doesn't need shadows, there are 2 ways to remove them:
1. Set the light angle to the same as the camera angle. (There is some weird shadow bleed that is weird.)
2. Set Camera with a very high Y if your game is top-down; otherwise, move it opposite the direction it's facing.

For more details, see: [[How to remove the shadows]]
