Changes how much momentum a physics object looses when bouncing. Use 0 for a complete stop and 1 for a perfect bounce.

You must also set bouncinness to the object you want it to bounce from.

**Please, note that anything higher than 1 would increase the velocity of the physics object each bounce.**
