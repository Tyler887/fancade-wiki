**Collided:** Triggers when the input object collides with another object, including the floor.

**2nd Object:** Outputs the object that the input object collided with. It'll output "None" if collided with the floor.

**Impulse:** Outputs the impact force of the collision (how hard did they collide). Specifically, impulse is a change of momentum of an object.

**Normal:** Outputs the direction of the impact from the object that the input object collided with.
