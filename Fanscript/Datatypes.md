In Fancade we have a total of 7 datatypes. These datatypes are Number, Vector, Rotation, Truth, Object, Constraint, and List.

The `Number`type can be either a whole number or in decimals, in the programming world we call these "int" and "float/double".

Here are some examples:
```coffeescript
Number jumpSpeed = 0.2
Vector level = (1, 1, -10)
Rotation fan = {0.1, 0, 0}
Truth blocked = False
Object me = MyBlocks.Me
```
To create variables simply type:
`Datatype variableName`

And to initialize:
`Datatype variableName = value`
