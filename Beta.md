Players with Fancade Beta have early access to new features, so those people can report bugs and avoid everyone from running into them when the official update gets released.

You can sign up for beta on the Fancade page in the Play Store. If you have done that, the displayname of the app will be `Fancade (beta)` instead of `Fancade`. Good luck with testing new features!
