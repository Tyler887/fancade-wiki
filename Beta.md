The Beta version of Fancade usually has more fixes and features than the normal Fancade version but it may have some untested bugs which the Beta players can report to the Fancade discord server's #bugs channel, so that everyone else don't run into the bugs on the stable Fancade releases.

You can sign up for beta on the Fancade page in the Play Store by clicking the `join` button below the install button. If you have done that, the displayname of the app will be `Fancade (beta)` instead of `Fancade`.

Good luck with testing new features and remember to report the bugs to Martin!
