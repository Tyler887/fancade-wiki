Started playing Fancade for the first time? Here's what you could do:
* Play the [[Quest]], then explore the [[arcade]]
* Check the video tutorials or Martin's tutorial game on the Kits heading in [[Build]]
* Make your own game
* Create your Fancade account (make sure to not use an inappropriate text or your real name as your nickname on Fancade)
* Try Fancade for free as long as you want, then get [[Fancade Premium|You#premium]] to support Martin, remove ads and 24h publish cooldown, and get [[gems]].
