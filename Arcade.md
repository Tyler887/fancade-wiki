The Arcade tab is where you can discover new games every day! It has a number of headings:

#### Favorites
Whenever you tap the Favorite button on a game, it appears here. It's a convenient way to bookmark games you like and want to play again. Even works offline!

#### Featured
These are the best of the best, a list of games hand-picked by [[Martin|Martin Magni]] because they're all worth playing, and show off what can be accomplished in Fancade. Here's how *you* can [[get your game featured|How to get your game featured]]!

#### Search
Use the search feature to find games! You can search by either the name of the game or the creator's name. You can also search games on your browser here: [[fancade.com/search/|https://www.fancade.com/search/]]

#### Popular
An automatic list of games other users are currently playing and liking. (The exact ranking algorithm is a work in progress.)

#### Categories
List all games with a specific tag. But the most important button is New, where you'll see every game and every update, listed newest first.

#### Linked
Whenever you click a game link, in [[search|https://www.fancade.com/search/]] or as shared on social media, the game box will appear here.
