The Arcade tab is where you can discover new games every day! The top headings feature selected games that are fun to play and have [[good design|How to get your game featured]]. In addition, there are some headings with special functionality:

#### Favorites
Whenever you tap the Favorite button on a game, it appears here. It's a convenient way to bookmark games you like and want to play again. Even offline!

#### Popular
An automatic list of games other users have recently played and liked. (This feature is only available on Android. Also, the exact ranking algorithm is a work in progress.)

#### Categories
List all games with a specific tag. The New button will list every published or updated game in newest order on Android, or every featured game in chronological order on iOS.

#### Search
Use the search feature to find games! You can search by either the name of the game or the creator's name.

#### Linked
Whenever you click a game link (e.g. as shared on social media), it will appear in this heading.
