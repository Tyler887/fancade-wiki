Quest is Fancade's story mode. You play as Odd, a cute little robot, travelling from island to island to get home. You must help him by completing the [[games|#games]] which populate the islands! Each island features 3 to 5 games, and with over 50 worlds there is more than 1,000 levels to play, with more being added in app updates!

At each island, you must complete challenges and collect stars to unlock more islands, and sometimes an extra criterion is added, such as completing at least 20% of the levels in the preceding island. 

Only about half of the stars are required to proceed to the next island, so completing all levels is not necessary. If there is a level or game that you can't complete or don't want to play, you can skip it (so don't feel you need to 100% all the challenges if you don't want to). 

If you ever get stuck, finding a particular level or challenge too difficult, you can
- Search for the game below, to see if it has its own wiki page with hints
- Search [[YouTube|https://www.youtube.com/]] for e.g. "Fancade Longcat" to find walkthrough videos
- Ask for help in our [[Discord chat|Discord]]

Each world contains exactly 100 stars, so you can easily compare your progress with friends. But the order of games is personalized, e.g., your World 3 may not have the exact same challenges as someone else's. 

If you want to reset your Quest progress, tap 20 times on the You tab to reveal the Reset Quest button. **Be warned that this action cannot be undone!**
