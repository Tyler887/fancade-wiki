The coins are for buying upgrades in the individual [game shops](https://www.fancade.com/wiki/How%20to%20use%20the%20shop%20system.md). You are able to buy them with [gems](https://www.fancade.com/wiki/Gems.md), or collected in game via the [Set Score](https://www.fancade.com/wiki/Blocks/Set%20Score.md) block. Many fancaders say that this is actually fangold.
