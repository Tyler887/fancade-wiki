Ok, so you're here to learn about how to use the shop system don't ya? Well, i'm Tha Cuber and im gonna tell you everything i figured out while using the shop system.

*** Coins ***
To use the coins, just take a number variable and stick it to the coins input in the score block. When playing the game you should see the coin counter at the corner of the screen. To get coins just increment the variable you used as the coin counter.

*** Menu items ***
To use the menu items, first take the block out of the inventory, then you get two kinds of inputs: a picture input and a variable input.

The Picture input is the object that will show when looking at the according upgrade it references.

The Variable input uses a variable to save the current state of the upgrade.

There's also other options when you select the block:

Name: the name of the item in the shop. If there's no object connected to the Picture input then it'll show as a section.

On/Off: this sets the amount of times that upgrade can be bought. For example, let's say you set it on Max 2.
The corresponding upgrade in the shop system will have to be bought 2 times to be maxed out.
If you leave it as On/Off, you'll be able to buy it onve, and toggle it on and off, kinda like an extra mode or a cheat code or something.

10 Fixed: this changes the price of the upgrade after you've bought it. If left on 10 Fixed, the price will stay on 10 coins every time you buy the upgrade. If it is on 10 Linear, then the price will increase by 10 coins each time you buy the upgrade. If set to 10 Double, then the price doubles each time you buy the upgrade. And you even get a bigger price if you keep clicking after 10 Double! The existing prices are 100, 1k (1,000) and 10k (10,000) and all of them have the same options except for 10k, which only has the fixed option.

And that's about it! If the page needs some extra information, or i wrote something wrong, please correct it. Also, this page should have some images, so if you can help with that, it'll be greatly appreciated. Let's keep updating this page so more people can learn how to use the shop system!
