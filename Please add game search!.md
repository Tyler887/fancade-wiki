Search has been added in Fancade android 1.2.4

~~Fun fact, all my initial Fancade design sketches had a game search tab. Then I discovered just *how difficult* search is when the data you want to search is stored somewhere else, changing in real time, and potentially very large. With great remorse I removed the search button from Fancade, hoping to add it back at a later time.

But don't despair! I've created a prototype search functionality on Fancade's web site: [[www.fancade.com/search|http://www.fancade.com/search/]]. Using "deep link" technology you should be able to open any search result in-app. It's not 100% real-time, so search results may be delayed by a day or two. But, then again, if the game you're looking for was published today, just find it in the New tab?~~
