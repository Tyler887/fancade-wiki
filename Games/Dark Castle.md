Dark Castle is a game by RF, or Richard Fu. You need to push yellow boxes to get to the goal!

## How to Play

Swipe in any direction to move the character to that respective direction. You can push any golden blocks to your goal. The green block is your goal. If you stand on it, you win! Ladders help you move up. Either if a block crushes you or an enemy gets to you, you lose. You can crush enemies using boxes.

## Hints
* In "Gap Filler", There's a reason why there's a hole in the wall.
* In "Box Juggler", you need all boxes to be in all layers.
* In "Deadend", don't wall off the enemy more than you are supposed to.
* In "Final Escape", the most bottom-left row in the level is useful.
