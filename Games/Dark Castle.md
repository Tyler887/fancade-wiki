# How to play
Swipe in any direction to move the character to that respective direction.
You can push any golden blocks to your goal.
The green block is your goal as if you stand on it, you win.
The ladder can help you move up.
Either if a block crushes you or an enemy gets to you, you lose.
You can crush enemies.
# Hints
* In "Gap Filler", Theres a reason why theres a hole in the wall.
* In "Box Juggler", you need all boxes to be in all layers.
* In "Deadend", don't wall off the enemy more than you are supposed to.
* In "Final Escape", the enemy cant go backwards, and that 1 notch can help the monster escape.
