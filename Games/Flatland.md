Flatland is a one-tap game by [[Martin Magni]].

## How to play

Tap to make the character jump. The character automatically runs and turns when it hits the left side of the level or the wall. If the character hits a wall, it clings or slides down to it. The character can jump while in the wall. Spikes will reset the character's position to the start, but the keys are kept. Gates are unlocked if you have enough keys. To win, exit to the right side of the level.
