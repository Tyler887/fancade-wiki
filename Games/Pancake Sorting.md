# How to Play

Hold your finger to the pancakes. A line indicator should appear. Then, drag up and down to what pancakes you must flip. When the finger is released, the pancakes above the line are flipped. (To cancel it, move your finger away from it and release.)

The goal is to order the pancakes increasing down in size, with limited number of moves in the top-right.
