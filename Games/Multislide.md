# How to play

Tap and swipe on a ball to slide it in that direction. Get all normal balls to the checkered tiles!
Later levels will involve boxes that can be pushed by balls, stone balls which become static after it has moved in that direction, and colored buttons which turn on the corresponding gate when activated by anything above it.

Tap with two fingers to undo the last move.

# Solutions

(Note: if there is only one ball on the field, no image is shown, rather, it shows the directions to slide that ball.

Otherwise, an image is shown (when applicable). In the format "1 left, down, 2 up, 1 right", this means "slide the ball enumerated 1 on the image left, then down. Next, slide the ball enumerated 2 up, and finally, slide the ball enumerated 1 right.")
