# Tips for levels 41-50

**Level 41**
<br> Placing the first ball on the goal position is not too difficult. To proceed, place the remaining balls at the bottom like this:

After that, place the left ball next to the door and then the right one on the switch. The goal positions are now accessible for both.

**Level 42**
<br> Without moving the grey balls, place the purple balls in the following way:

Now, after moving both grey balls down, the goal positions are easily accessible.

**Level 43**
<br> Push the box to the side and place one ball right below (or above) it:

Now, the remaining three balls can be placed onto the visible goal positions. Pushing the box up (or down) is the last move.

**Level 44**
<br> Moving the balls on both sides of the level independently, arrange them in the following way:

Now simply move the upper balls to the right and the lower balls to the left.

**Level 45**
<br> First, move the upper grey ball so that it stops right after the upper goal position. Next, arrange the purple balls at the bottom of the level, like this:

Move both purple balls up and then move the grey ball to the right.
