[[Fixel|https://fancade.page.link/reRt]] is a puzzle game made by [[Martin Magni]]. It consists of a stencyl of an object or a structure (e.g. an orange) that has to be filled perfectly with a few given pieces that interlock into the stencyl through their holes in order to win.

Fun fact: level "Orange" is considered to be the most difficult level in the game.
