Fixel is a puzzle game made in [Fancade](fancade.com) by [Martin Magni](martinmagni.com). It consists of a stencyl of an object or a structure (e.g.- an orange, as shown in the image) that has to be filled perfectly with a few given pieces that interlock into the stencyl through their holes in order to win.

*Pssssst...The Orange level in Fixel is considered to be the most difficult levels in the game.
