Nonsense is a game by R3DZ3R, where you rearrange color tiles on a checkerboard within some rules.

## How to Play

Drag a tile to move it. Rearrange the color tiles until they match these rules:

* Two or more tiles with the same color can be near each other
* Two or more tiles with different color shouldn't near each other

The same rule applies to locked tiles and 1x1 tile combination.
