## Rules
### Swapping

Hold any frames to try to stop time and attempt to move a frame, if the selected frame has a red or yellow border surrounding it, or the bot is in the middle of 2 panels, it makes a sound, otherwise time stops and you can swap, the swap must be a white border to white border, if theres no blue borders and you release, the held frame would be back to the original spot, but if there is a blue border (a spot you wanna swap with), it swaps the 2 frames, either case, time starts again. You can make infinite swaps at any time except if the bot in the middle of 2 frames.

### The Bot

The bot will always start moving right, and if it ever encounters a wall or border of the map, the bot would turn. If the bot hits the spikes from above or the sides or falls down a gap to an empty place, you lose, if it hits the flag, you win, the bot will fall to all gaps, and can collect keys.

### Other Things

* Red bordered frames can't be moved at all.
* Yellow bordered frames can only be moved after getting a key.
* Pink lines show that you can only swap frames in the same pink regions.
