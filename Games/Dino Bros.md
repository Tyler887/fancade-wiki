In Dino Bros you control 2 dinos with different height, and your goal is to reach them to the exit!
Later levels will include platforms that fall after a certain amount of moves, spikes that will activate periodically, and buttons that will move a platform up.

This puzzle game is based on the earlier game [[Ditto]], which is also made by [[Martin Magni]].
