In [Dino Bros](https://play.fancade.com/5FFEEA620BE54704) you control 2 dinos with different height, and your goal is to reach them to the exit!
Later levels will include platforms that fall after a certain amount of moves, spikes that will activate periodically, and buttons that will move a platform up.

This puzzle game is based on the earlier game [[Ditto]], which is also made by [[Martin Magni]].

_Note that the above video walkthrough of Level 41 uses a hidden area to stack the dinos to get the last key. This unintended solution has been fixed. Instead, use the staircase to stack Pinky on top of Yello._
