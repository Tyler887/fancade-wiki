Bally is a game by Tyler 2013 where you help the ball through 9 levels to stop blue germs from spreading. (There was a typo in the description saying that it would have 35.)

## How to Play

Tap the left or right button to roll. Tap the up button to jump. Your goal is to get to the goal block without hitting any viruses or falling.

Note that the Levels 1-3 walkthrough contains a bug where Bally jumps higher that how high he jumps normally. This unintended bug has been fixed.
