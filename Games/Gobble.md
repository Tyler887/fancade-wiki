In [Gobble](https://play.fancade.com/5F39593BFC59C233) you play as a giant monster mouth, eating everything in sight! Except people. You're allergic to people.

Each series of 10 levels adds a new twist to the basic mechanic. The game is based on the earlier game [Hole](https://play.fancade.com/5D0E52CAC34823EE), also by [[Martin Magni]], and inspired by [Mouth](https://play.fancade.com/5E80AD79BECB385E) by nmskr.
