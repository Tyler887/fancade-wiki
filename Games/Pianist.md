[Pianist](https://play.fancade.com/5E99CD887C4A8028) by james1236 is a modified version of ViChavln's Pianist (which is now deleted) which is inspired by [Piano Tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Tiles) and Piano Tiles 2, and your goal is to finish the piece by tapping those white tiles without missing or failing to win.

# How to Play
The tiles move down, Tap on a tile to interact with a tile, if the interacted tile is white and not out of order, it will play the correct note, the white tile becomes black, you can continue to the next white tile safely, and would not lose if the tile goes offscreen, if you interact with any black tile, even a tile that is already tapped correctly, it will play a random note, display a skull, and you would lose, if you interact with a white tile out of order, it would play that tile's corresponding note, and show which tile to actually tap, and you would lose. if you let a white tile go offscreen, it would show which tile you missed and you would lose. If you tap on the final white tile, it will show you a heart and you would win. **Note that the tile's positions are random.**

# Strategy
The most important strategy is to follow the rhythm of the song and only focus on the tile's positions, because while the positions of the tiles are randomized, the timings aren't, and the timings is the rhythm of the song.
