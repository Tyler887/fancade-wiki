[Color Break](https://play.fancade.com/5F5A4E32A2926D92) is a game made by LukaszM where you have to destroy all colored blocks without markings and surviving for a split second without getting hit by a skull block to win.

## How to Play

You start with a predetermined ball color. Hold on the left and right side of the screen to move the ball. The ball automatically bounces up and down. To destroy an unmarked block, hit the unmarked block with the same color as your color of ball, you win if you destroy all of the blocks. The ball bounces off if a ball hits a block of a different color.

An exclamation (!) block cannot be destroyed, but instead it can be moved from the direction the block was hit from by hitting it with the same colored ball.

An asterisk (*) block changes the color to the block's color you hit.

A skull block will make the ball explode when hit and lose.
