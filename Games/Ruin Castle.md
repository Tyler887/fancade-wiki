# How to play

Swipe any direction for the knight to move.
Everytime you move, the the pillar you are previously on falls.
To win, break all but 1 pillars and if theres a crown, go to the crown tile last.
If you either go out of step, get the crown too early, or go to an enemy tile W/O holding a sword, you lose.
