Odd Bot is a puzzle game where you help a cute little robot, called Odd, to reach a spinning golden cube. Tap to walk, drag the white rectangles to move sliders and elevators, and swipe anywhere else to rotate the view. (It might look like you are playing Mekorama!)

# Fun Facts
Yes, it's *possible* to push Odd off the level, e.g. by hitting the poor little bot in the head with a giant stone slab! While it's a neat little easter egg, many users reported it as a bug. So now the Game Over dialog will pop up if you fall off, to make it clear you can't climb back up onto the level.

The golden cube is a reference to a famous indie game. Can you guess which one? ðŸ™‚
