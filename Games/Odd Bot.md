# How to Play
Your goal is to get the cute little robot, called Odd, to the spinning golden cube.
Tap the white square dots to walk. Drag the white rectangles to move sliders and elevators. Swipe anywhere else to rotate the view.

# Fun Facts
Yes, it's *possible* to push Odd off the level, e.g. by hitting the poor little bot in the head with a giant stone slab! I considered this a neat little easter egg, but many users reported it as a bug. (Thanks for notifying me!) So I made the Game Over dialog pop up if you fall off, so it's clear you can't climb back up onto the level.

The golden cube is a reference to one of my favorite games. Can you guess which one? ðŸ™‚
