Odd Bot is a puzzle game where you help a cute little robot, called Odd, to reach a spinning golden cube. Tap to walk, drag the white rectangles to move sliders and elevators, and swipe anywhere else to rotate the view.

# Fun Facts
Yes, it's *possible* to push Odd off the level, e.g. by hitting the poor little bot in the head with a giant stone slab! Martin Magni considered this a neat little easter egg, but many users reported it as a bug. (Thanks for notifying!) So he made the Game Over dialog pop up if you fall off, so it's clear you can't climb back up onto the level.

The golden cube is a reference to one of his favorite games. Can you guess which one? ðŸ™‚
