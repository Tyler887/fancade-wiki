Odd Bot is a game made by [[Martin Magni]]. The goal is to get the cute little robot, called Odd, to the spinning golden cube. The player can tap any places where odd can walk. Sometimes there will be white rectangles that can move sliders and elevators. The player also has an option to rotate the camera.

# Fun Facts
Yes, it's *possible* to push Odd off the level, e.g. by hitting the poor little bot in the head with a giant stone slab! I considered this a neat little easter egg, but many users reported it as a bug. (Thanks for notifying me!) So I made the Game Over dialog pop up if you fall off, so it's clear you can't climb back up onto the level.

The golden cube is a reference to one of my favorite games. Can you guess which one? ðŸ™‚
