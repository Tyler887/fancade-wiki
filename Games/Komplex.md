**Goal**

Some Komplex levels might have different goal to achieve, but most of them are about collecting white cubes and sokoban.

If you see a Komplex level contains white cubes, the goal might be to collect those cubes. If you see a Komplex level contains PushBox and PushBox detectors, the goal might be to push those PushBoxes to the detectors.
