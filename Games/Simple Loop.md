[[Simple Loop|https://fancade.page.link/ot6T]] is a puzzle game where you draw a single loop that passes through all unshaded cells.

# Rules

Draw lines by dragging between unshaded cells. To win, these criterias must be met:

- There are no intersecting, branching, or dead-end lines.
- The loop must pass through all unshaded cells.
- There is only one loop.

The game will mark errors when found.

# Tips and Tricks

In every solved Simple loop puzzle, there are always 2 lines going through a cell. Therefore these basic deductions can be made:

Using the only one loop rule, this basic deduction can also be made:

In solving harder Simple Loop puzzles, a bit of visualization must be made. Take a look at this common pattern:

Basic deductions are shown.

Now imagine there was no line (indicated by ×) in the above picture. Then, this is forced to be a single loop. Therefore there must be a line here:

[[/uploads/simpleloop-tips-2c.png | height=200px]]

You can do chains of deductions using this logic:

Imagine there was no line here. Then it is forced to be a single loop once again:

Similarly:

Basic deductions shown.

With the cross mark shown above, the loop is forced to close with incomplete cells.

Another pattern that might show:

[[/uploads/simpleloop-tips-4a.png | height=150px]]

Basic deductions applied.

[[/uploads/simpleloop-tips-4b.png | height=150px]]

With cross mark shown, lines get forced like this, and the marked cell (in red) can only have dead-end lines, giving this:

[[/uploads/simpleloop-tips-4c.png | height=150px]]

--------------

Lastly:

[[/uploads/simpleloop-tips-5a.png | height=200px]]

Basic deductions.

[[/uploads/simpleloop-tips-5b.png | height=200px]]

Without a line here (×), the marked cell becomes a dead-end:
