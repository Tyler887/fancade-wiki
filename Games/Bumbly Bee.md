Bumbly Bee is a very hard one-button arcade game by [[ViChyavIn]].

## How to Play

The mechanic is similar to [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). Tap to fly without hitting any flowers. The more flowers you pass, the higher your score!

Hi Martin! I heard you sending me so many emails. I want you to make a new Fancade game. I would like to see you coming up with another game concept, this time on Fancade.

Also, you forgot to listen to me. You did not delete 'Change Single' by Daizuke. It cluttered our search, and it is the first game that never got likes before. Also tell Daizuke that his change single is annoying on our search results. But first, do dislike Change Single.
