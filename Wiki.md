title: Fancade Wiki
---

*The wiki is developed by [[Nikita Ivanov|ViChyavIn]], Olle Landin, and [[Martin Magni]].*

This wiki helps users learn more about Fancade and its [[game-making tools|Build]]. Pages are written by Fancade users (Fancaders) themselves. Maybe you want to help improve the wiki too?

# Rules

Yes? You'd like to contribute? Great!! Here's some advice to help you get started editing.

## Write about Fancade

The wiki is about [Fancade](https://fancade.com) and its [[game making tools|Build]], so try to stay on topic. So don't write about anything different from Fancade and its [[game making tools|Build]].

## Create a page

Before creating a brand *new* wiki page, make sure to check if:

* The page already exists, even with a different name?
* The info doesn't fit better as a note on an existing page?
* The page is likely to be useful to other Fancade users?

## Don't save unfinished edits

Do not leave articles in work in progress state.

If you're not done yet, but you can't continue working right now, you can always quit the browser and get back to editing later. The wiki will remember the state of the page and will prompt you to recover it when you begin editing again.

## Don't leave unanswered questions

If you're not sure about something, don't ask future readers to correct you in the page:

<blockquote>
[[Constraints]] are very hard to learn. (Maybe it's just me?)
</blockquote>

Those who can answer your question will rarely visit your page, so you will end up throwing your question at readers'. Feel free to join our [[Discord]] server and ask your question there, in order to eventually provide the most accurate information to readers!

# How-to

Want to help but have no idea how it's done? Read below to learn how to format text and create new pages.

## Create a page

In the Wiki, there is an ability to create new pages, simply by clicking "New". A pop-up with the title "Create New Page" should show up.

Create a page name with the right title.

If you are writing it in a different area of the Wiki (e.g. Build) write `<area>/<title>` (e.g. `Build/Set Variable`) to create it there.

Now you can write a Wiki page! After you have written it all, click "Preview" to make sure everything looks correct.

## Style a page

The Wiki supports the formatting syntax called "Markdown". You can make text **bold**, *italic*, ***bolditalic***, and ~~strikethrough~~. Also you can:

* [[Make lists|#make-list]]
* [[Add links|#add-link]]
* [[Add images|#add-image]]

### Basics

#### Add link

To insert a link, you can:

| Wrap page name in square brackets | `[[Number]]` | [[Number]]
| Wrap page name in square brackets and put a suffix | `[[Number]]s` | [[Number]]s
| Wrap page name in square brackets and set displayed text | `[[One|Number]]` | [[One|Number]]
| Wrap URL in square brackets | `[[http://fancade.com/]]` | [[http://fancade.com/]]
| Wrap URL in square brackets and set displayed text | `[[Fancade|http://fancade.com/]]` | [[Fancade|http://fancade.com/]]

#### Make list

To insert a list element, put `*`, `+` or `-` at the beginning of a line. For example,

```
* Fancade
* is the fanmade
* arcade
```
will be

* Fancade
* is the fanmade
* arcade

#### Add image

To add an image, drag-n-drop it into the edit form. (It will be uploaded to `/uploads/<filename>`)

To insert an existing image, you wrap the image path/URL in square brackets (like you do with regular links/URLs) to insert it directly in the text.

```[[uploads/image.jpg]]```

You can also upload an image by clicking "Upload" button in edit mode.

## Delete a page

Deleting a page is possible, but restricted. Ping one of the Fanmods on the Discord server and suggest the deletion to them.

## Revert a change

Go to the page's history (through link in the latest changes), check the commit, compare and revert.

## Rename a page

Click Rename, and enter the new page name. If you want to move it, then enter `<area>/<title>`.

## Sign out

There's no button to sign out or seldom reason to. But if you clear the website data in your browser settings, you will be signed out. (It's a cookie?)

## Notes

* You can switch between edit and preview mode with `Ctrl+Shift+P`. (When using touchscreens you cannot do this.)
