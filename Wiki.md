This wiki was developed by [[Nikita Ivanov|ViChyavIn]], [[Olle Landin|https://twitter.com/ollelandin]], and [[Martin Magni|Martin Magni]].

You can help expand the wiki by creating new pages and improving existing ones!

# How to make a wiki page?

In the Wiki page, there is an ability to create new pages, simply by clicking "New". A pop-up with the title "Create New Page" should show up.

Create a page name with the appropriate title.

If you are writing it in a different section (e.g. Build) write `<section>/\<title>` (e.g. `Build/Set Variable`) to create it within this section.

Now you can write a Wiki page! After you have written it all, click "Preview" to make sure everything looks correct.

# Wiki formatting

The Wiki supports the formatting syntax called "[[Markdown|https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet]]". You can easily make *italic*, **bold**, __underlined__ or ~~strikethrough~~ text. To learn how, read [[this|https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-]].

Besides, there are such Wiki-exclusive formatting features as unordered lists, links and images in text.

To insert a list element, put `*`, `+` or `-` at the beginning of a line. Note that there must be one blank line before the first element.

To insert a link, you can:

* wrap page name in square brackets: [[Add]] `[[Add]]`
* do the same but put a suffix if needed: [[Vector]]s `[[Vector]]s`
* wrap page name in parentheses and set displayed text in square brackets before: [[Plus|Add]] `[[Plus|Add]]`
* do the same but put any URL instead of a page name: [[Fancade|http://fancade.com/]] `[[Fancade|http://www.fancade.com/]] `

To add an image, drag-n-drop it into the edit form. (It'll upload to `/uploads/<filename>`)

To insert an image, you can wrap the image URL in `!` to insert it directly in the text.
