This wiki was developed by [[Nikita Ivanov|https://twitter.com/ViChyavIn]], [[Olle Landin|https://twitter.com/ollelandin]], and [[Martin Magni|https://twitter.com/MartinMagni]].

You can help expand the wiki by [[creating new pages|How to make a wiki page?]] in the [[Fancade Discord|Discord]]! There's even [[wiki formatting]] support.

Fanmods can use advanced Fanbot commands (in the #fanbot channel, not DM) like:
- ".tag topic" to create new topics. E.g., to assign the [[Odd Bot]] page to a new "Games" topic: `.tag topic odd_bot Games`
- ".tag delete <page>" to delete a page. E.g.: `.tag delete "Today is Fancade launch day!"`

To add an image, drag-n-drop it into the edit form. (It'll upload to /uploads/<filename>)
