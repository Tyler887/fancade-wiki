This wiki was developed by [[Nikita Ivanov|ViChyavIn]], [[Olle Landin|https://twitter.com/ollelandin]], and [[Martin Magni]].

You can help expand the wiki by creating new pages and improving existing ones!

# Create a page

In the Wiki page, there is an ability to create new pages, simply by clicking "New". A pop-up with the title "Create New Page" should show up.

Create a page name with the appropriate title.

If you are writing it in a different section (e.g. Build) write `<section>/<title>` (e.g. `Build/Set Variable`) to create it within this section.

Now you can write a Wiki page! After you have written it all, click "Preview" to make sure everything looks correct.

# Style a page

The Wiki supports the formatting syntax called "Markdown". You can easily make *italic*, **bold** or ~~strikethrough~~ text. Moreover, with Markdown, you also can make lists, add links, insert images in text and even make tables! Read [[this|https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet]] to learn how.

## Basics

To insert a link, you can:

* wrap page name in square brackets: [[Number]] `[[Number]]`
* do the same but put a suffix if needed: [[Vector]]s `[[Vector]]s`
* wrap page name in parentheses and set displayed text in square brackets before: [[One|Number]] `[[One|Number]]`
* do the same but put any URL instead of a page name: [[Fancade|http://fancade.com/]] `[[Fancade|http://www.fancade.com/]] `

To insert a list element, put `*`, `+` or `-` at the beginning of a line.

To add an image, drag-n-drop it into the edit form. (It will be uploaded to `/uploads/<filename>`)

To insert an existing image, you wrap the image path/URL in square brackets (like you do with regular links/URLs) to insert it directly in the text.

# Delete a page

Deleting a page is possible, but restricted. Ping one of the Fanmods on the Discord server and suggest the deletion to them.

# Revert a change

Go to the page's history (through link in the latest changes), check the commit, compare and revert.

# Signing out

There's no button to sign out (and seldom reason to). But if you clear the website data in your browser settings, you will be signed out. (It's a cookie?)
