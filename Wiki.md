# How to make a wiki page?

In the Wiki page, there is an ability to create new pages, simply by clicking "New". A pop-up with the title "Create New Page" should show up.

Create a page name with the appropriate title.

If you are writing it in a different section (e.g. Build) write `<section>/\<title>` (e.g. `Build/Set Variable`) to create it within this section.

Now you can write a Wiki page! After you have written it all, click "Preview" to make sure everything looks correct.

Check the [[wiki formatting|Wiki formatting]] for all the syntax tools.
